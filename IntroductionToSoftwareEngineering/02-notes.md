## Agile Practice
---
### Product Backlog
---
- Construct using user stories
- Organize and provide information to devs what sholud do
- Who is in charge - Product owner
- i.e. "To Do List"
- Check point -> motivate team to work and produce deliverable in each check point
- Each week is a sprint
  - Starting point - plan
  - Ending point - review
  - Each week should have a finished use story (fully done)
    - tangible
    - prototype
    - fully intergrated
    - work well and fully functional
    - documented
    - have unit testing
    - not just classes and sandboxing
  - an incremnet of the project
- story points -> relatived unites measure of effort
  - amount / estimate of effort should put into a story
  - indicator of speed up
---
## Scrum
---
- Standup meeting - Status of the project
  - what was done
  - what to do
  - what is "blocking" me
---
#### "Fail First"
---
- Work on the high priority and high risk task first
- "Fail First" so that a team can find out issues earlier and resolve them
---
#### Dividing An Architecture
---
- Split an architecture in a vertical manner instead of horizontal manner
  - In one split, it should include all types of classes (Boundary, Control, Entity) instead of one specific type of classes (Horizontally)
- Allow the end user to interact (front end) instead of only backend with no interactable.
