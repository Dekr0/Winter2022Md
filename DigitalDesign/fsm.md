# Sequential Logic
---
- Three digital logic blocks
  - Next state combination logic block
  - Memory block
  - Output combination logic block
---
## Finite State Machine
---
### Moore State Machine
---
- Connection of three digital logic blocks
- Inputs $\rightarrow$ Next state combination logic block $\rightarrow$ Memory block $\rightarrow$ Output combination logic $\rightarrow$ Outputs
---
### Mealy State Machine
---

---
### Difference between Moore State Machine and Mealy State Machine
---
- The difference is in the way the output is genereated.
- The output of Moore State Machine is the function of present state only
- The output of Mealy State Machine is the function of present state as well as the inputs
