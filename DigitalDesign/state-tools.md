## State Diagram
---
- State tables: show relationship of present states, next states, inputs and outputs
- State tables $\rightarrow$ State Diagram
- Number of states in a state diagram $\leftarrow$ number of flip flops in circuits
    - $2^n$ - n is a number of flip flops

## Design Procedure for Clocked Sequential Circuits

---

1. A state diagram or timing diagram is given, which describes the behaviour of the circuit that is to be designed.
2. Obtain the state table.
3. The number of states can be reduced by state reduction method.
4. Do state assignment. (**If required**)
5. Determine the number of FF required and assign letter symbols.
6. Decide the type of FF to be used.
7. Derive the circuit execution table from state table
8. Obtain the expression for circuit output and FF input
9. Implement the circuit
